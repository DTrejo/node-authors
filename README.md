## Hacking

### Reporting a bug

If you meet a bug or get confused, please let us know by [firing a Issue](https://github.com/DTrejo/node-authors/issues/new).

### Developing

```
$ git clone https://github.com/DTrejo/node-authors.git
$ cd node-authors
$ npm link
```

- The latest version is placed on master branch.
- Releases is tagged with its version number (e.g. `v0.0.2`).
- Features working in progress is developed on separate branches. Once it is finished and tested, it would be merged into master branch.

### Testing

_TODO: tests is still missing..._

```
$ make test
```

### Committing a patch

It would be great to develop on a separate branch instead of the master branch. Before making a Pull Request, please confirm all tests is passed.

If it is a bugfix, please also write a test case that proves the bug.
