# authors [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com/) [![npm Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/authors.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/authors)

Generates a list of authors/contributors of an git repository with
GitHub links.

## Installation

```
$ npm -g install authors
```


## Usage

```
$ cd my-git-repo
$ authors
```

### Optional Authentication

To get around GitHub's API rate limiting you can provide a personal
OAuth2 access token, e.g.

```
$ OAUTH_TOKEN=43db965473740003c87b6467dd7aed645f832d1c authors
```

> You can create and revoke
> [personal access tokens in your account settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
> For this use case no special permissions are required, so `public
> access` is sufficient.

- Features working in progress is developed on separate branches. Once
  it is finished and tested, it would be merged into master branch.

### Testing

_TODO: tests is still missing..._

```
$ npm test
```

### Committing a patch
